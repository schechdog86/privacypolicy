1. Information We Collect
We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Services to you.

a) Information You Provide Directly:

Account Information: When you create an account, we may collect your name, email address, and a password.

3. Legal Basis for Processing (For EEA/UK Users)
If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, our legal basis for collecting and using your information is:

The performance of a contract with you (e.g., to provide the Services you requested).

Your consent (e.g., for marketing emails), which you can withdraw at any time.

Our legitimate interests (e.g., for security, analytics, and improving our Services), which do not override your fundamental rights.

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information in the following situations:

Service Providers: We employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g., cloud hosting, payment processing, customer support, analytics). These third parties have access to your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).

Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as a business asset.

With Your Consent: We may share your information for any other purpose with your explicit consent.

We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.

6. Data Security
The security of your data is important to us. We use commercially acceptable means (such as SSL encryption and secure servers) to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
